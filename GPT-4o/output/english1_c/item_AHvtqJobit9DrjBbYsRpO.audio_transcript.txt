Once upon a time, there was a super cool cartoon about a superhero named Flashboy! Flashboy could run super duper fast, faster than a cheetah! One day, he had to save the city from a giant rolling boulder. He ran around it super fast until it got dizzy and fell over! All the people in the city cheered, 'Yay, Flashboy!' And from then on, Flashboy was the bravest hero ever!
